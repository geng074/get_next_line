problem  with output strjoin
buffer[buffer_size + 1]
i should use byte read as indicator of buffer

flag issue... at ft_adv_buffer

You always return a null-terminated string.

The final visible character before the \0 should be \n if the file line had a newline.

Only the last line should be returned without \n if the file itself doesn't end with a newline.

If nothing more can be read (EOF and buffer is empty), return NULL.
